        "The random forest regressor was selected as the machine learning model due to the strong performance in the surveyed literature. In the work of Jackman & Reid (xxxx), it is the strongest performing model among the five regressors. In the work Martin et al. (xxxx), the random forest outpeforms all other models in a classification problem with the exception of voting classifiers, which are outside the scope of the course material. Additionally, Biau and Scornet (2015) praise the random forest algorithm for its 'ability to deal with small sample sizes and\n",

        "To understand the structure of the random forest we first must understand the structure of a decision tree. In a machine learning capacity, decision trees are comprised of nodes that are trained to split observations in a manner such that the groups that it generates are as dissimilar to eachother as possible. The amount of nodes that makes up a tree, and the manner in which the nodes behave is constrained by user-specified parameters. A random forest is a collection of decision trees that operate as a community to make a decision. In the case of our regressor, each tree in the forest will make a prediction on the case which it is passed. Following this, the random forest will return the average prediction among the trees. The underlying concept behind the random forest is a simple one, strength in numbers. The essence that the decision trees all come from a seperate origin and are uncorellated is key to the process, where each tree can sample a fraction of the data, grow a tree, and contribute to the community aggregation.\n",

In our case, we propose a grid with 1,536 different parameter combinations. Given the provided constraints, rsCV will randomly choose 100 candidates and fit 8 folds on each. The advantage this model provides is the ability to narrow down a very wide hyperparameter search to provide a rough idea of where the best hyperparameters sit, without sacrificing the integrity of the fit.

The intent is to randomly sample this set to match the size of the salaried data 10 times, and run a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to determine with statistical assertion whether or not there is a difference in the means. This evaluation is by no means intended to evaluate conclusive sampling bias, however it is intended to provide some perspective surrounding the school of thought that companies that do not advertise salary may choose to do so given their lacklustre offering capacity."
