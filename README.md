Hello readers,

This one is all done and potentially the academic work I am most proud of.

For future MA5851 lurkers, this scored a 86/100.
The main point for improvement was taking the discussion more in the direction of output as opposed to procedures. 

Whether you've come for a read as one of my mates, colleagues or someone completely off the beaten track, good luck to you.

Best,
Squinzano
